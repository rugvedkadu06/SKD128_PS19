## 💡 Tips for High-Precision Results
1. **Be Specific**: instead of "tell me about risk", ask "What are the four stages of risk assessment identified in Chapter 4?"
2. **Page References**: If you see a source in the **Intelligence Matrix**, you can follow up with "Tell me more about the logic mentioned on Page 12."
3. **Cross-Lingual**: You can ask in Marathi about an English document, and QARAG will synthesize the answer in Marathi using the English context!
